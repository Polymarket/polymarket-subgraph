# polymarket-subgraph

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
MATIC_RPC_URL=
```

Here, `MATIC_RPC_URL` should be your RPC URL for the Polygon network. Common providers include Alchemy and Infura.

## Running the test suite

Run `yarn test` to run the test suite, which will run in a docker container.

## Preparing `subgraph.yaml`

This repo contains multiple subgraphs, pnl-subgraph, activity-subgraph, and market-subgraph. Each subgraph has dedicated yarn scripts for convenience.

First, to prepare `subgraph.yaml` and other templated files, run `yarn templatify:matic`.

It's recommended to run the codegen command for the subgraph you're working on, as it will only generate the types and schemas for that subgraph. To do this, run `yarn pnl:codegen`, `yarn activity:codegen` or `yarn polymarket:codegen`.

## Local Deployment

To start the docker environment, run `docker compose up`. Once the environment is ready, create and deploy the subgraph:

```[bash]
yarn <subgraph>:create-local
yarn <subgraph>:deploy-local
```

Access the GraphQL editor at:

[`http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/polymarket-subgraph/graphql`](http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/polymarket-subgraph/graphql)

**Example query:**

```graphQL
query tokenIdConditions {
  tokenIdConditions {
    id
    condition
    complement
  }
}
```

## Restart graph node and clear volumes

```bash
docker compose down
```

```bash
sudo docker rm polymarket-subgraph-graph-node-1 && sudo docker rm polymarket-subgraph-ipfs-1 && sudo docker rm polymarket-subgraph-postgres-1 && sudo docker rm polymarket-subgraph-ganache-1
```

The names of you docker containers may vary; check the terminal.

## Goldsky

Build the subgraph with `yarn <subgraph>:build`, and deploy with:

```bash
goldsky subgraph deploy <subgraph-name>/<version> --path ./build/
```

## Running on an M1 Chip

To run locally on an M1 chip, you'll need to build a local copy of the graph-node docker image. To do this, clone the [graph-node repo](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) and run the following commands:

```bash
# Remove the original image
docker rmi graphprotocol/graph-node:latest

# Build the image
./docker/build.sh

# Tag the newly created image
docker tag graph-node graphprotocol/graph-node:latest
```

Note: you likely will have to increase your Docker daemon memory capacity. In Docker desktop you can find this setting under Preferences > Resources > Advanced.

## Contracts

These subgraphs track contracts from the following repositories:
